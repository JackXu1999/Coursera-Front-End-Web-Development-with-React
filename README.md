This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This is a finished coursework of [Front-End Development](https://www.coursera.org/learn/front-end-react/) with React on [Coursera](https://www.coursera.com).

Hope this repo can help if you ever get lost when completing this course.
